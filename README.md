<h2>Hosting Burgertunes</h2>
1. Clone burgertunes (git clone https://github.com/maaa101/burgertunes)<br>

3. Open main.py using a text editor, at the last line, change the host to "0.0.0.0" and the port to 8080.<br>
4. Install all the dependecies in "requirements.txt" using pip. (pip install -r requirements.txt)<br>
5. All done! ðŸŽ‰ Run main.py to start the server.<br>
